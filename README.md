## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
Our team took on the task of developing a user-friendly quiz application using Node Express. Below, you can see the key steps we followed in the planning and problem-solving process to ensure the success of our project.
- Brainstormed ideas as a group to create an appealing and interesting quiz web application.
- Identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) criteria and established additional features for future development.
- Utilised the Trello app to track and manage the progress of individual tasks, including crafting thoughtful user stories together as a team (as seen in the to-do column of Trello in the image below).
- Assigned tasks to team members based on their individual expertise and skills.
- Conducted regular testing to ensure the proper functioning of the application after making changes.
- Collaboratively resolved coding errors by utilising Zoom screensharing for quick and efficient problem-solving.
- Celebrated smaller milestones throughout the project to motivate and encourage team members.
- Leveraged the unique strengths and expertise of each team member to optimise productivity and efficiency.

- **Programming Languages**: The project utilises CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an interactive web application. These languages allow for dynamic content and provide a solid foundation for building engaging user interfaces.
- **CSS Animations**: To enhance the user experience, CSS animations have been implemented. These animations add visual appeal and make the application more interactive and engaging.
- **Background Music**: A background music feature has been incorporated into the web application. It adds ambiance and immerses users in the quiz-taking experience, creating a more enjoyable atmosphere.
