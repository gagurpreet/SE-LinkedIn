## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
My Plan was of developing a user-friendly Linkedin application using React and Node Express. Below, you can see the key steps I followed in the planning and problem-solving process to ensure the success of my project.
- Brainstormed ideas to create an appealing and interesting web application.
- Identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) criteria and established additional features for future development.
- Utilised the Trello app to track and manage the progress of individual tasks, including crafting thoughtful user stories.
- Conducted regular testing to ensure the proper functioning of the application after making changes.
- Celebrated smaller milestones throughout the project to motivate and encourage myself.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- **Programming Languages**: The project utilises CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an interactive web application. These languages allow for dynamic content and provide a solid foundation for building engaging user interfaces.
- **Framework**: React and Node Express
- **Code editor**: Visual Studio
- **React component library**: Material UI/Icons
- **Deployment**: Render
- **CSS Animations**: To enhance the user experience, CSS animations have been implemented. These animations add visual appeal and make the application more interactive and engaging.
- **API Integration**: The application leverages an API to access databse. This integration enables users to access data and ensures the availability for future refrences.
- **Post Management**: Users have the ability to create information within the application. 
- **User Authentication and Session Management**: The application includes user authentication features, allowing users to log in and sign up using sessions and cookies. This ensures the security of user data and provides a personalised experience by maintaining user-specific settings and progress.
By utilising these technologies and implementing these improvements, the project offers an engaging and user-friendly quiz-taking experience, enabling users to enhance their knowledge and have fun in the process.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :hankey:
- **Posts**: When user Clicks on Home page want to display all posts avaliable.
- **PageHighlight**: If a user clicks on specific page want to highlight the page user has clicked on.
- **Search Page**: Want to display something on page other than the search bar.
- **Post Acknowledgement**: Once users posts something on the web application. I want to display message telling them their post is saved and uploaded. And rerenders them to posts page.
  
## :sob: Lessons learnt
During the development of this project, several valuable lessons were learned. If given the opportunity to complete the project again, the following improvements would be considered:
- **Thorough Planning and Idea Exploration**: Taking more time to plan and think through ideas would allow for better anticipation of potential scenarios and edge cases. By considering a wider range of possibilities during the planning phase, it becomes easier to build the project correctly from the beginning, rather than making significant changes after the code is already written.
- **Frequent Committing and File Management**: Establishing a better system for committing code frequently and managing files effectively is crucial. This practice helps prevent conflicts and ensures that work can be synchronised smoothly. By committing code regularly, it becomes easier to track changes and roll back if necessary.
- **Prioritise Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**: Focusing on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before adding additional features is essential. It is important to ensure that the core functionality of the application is robust and well-implemented before dedicating time to CSS styling or incorporating extra features. This approach allows for a solid foundation and avoids unnecessary complexities during development.
- **Iterative Development and Testing**: Adopting an iterative development approach can greatly improve the overall quality of the project. Regular testing and refinement at each iteration ensure that issues are identified and resolved early on, leading to a more stable and reliable application.
By implementing these lessons learned, future projects can benefit from a more efficient and effective development process, resulting in higher-quality software and an improved overall experience for both developers and users.
